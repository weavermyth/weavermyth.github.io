      <description>Sound systems in computers have fascinated me for years, I have done countless research on them, but my knowledge is still very superficial. Every year, at certain times, I do research about old computers, sound cards, graphics cards, games, and learn over and over again what I know.
I worked a lot on sound cards, especially on Sound Blaster and its models. Although I know many fine details, I have learned many things wrongly due to the information pollution on the internet and the indirect explanation of some expressions instead of the correct ones.</description>
